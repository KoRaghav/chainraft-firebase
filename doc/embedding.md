# Embedding in a Webpage

In addition to using the TLA+ web explorer from the main interface, you can also embed various features of the TLA+ web explorer in other web pages. All of the functionality is self-contained and runnable in the browser, so it should be relatively straightforward.

For now, you can see a basic example embedding just the interpreter functionality in a simple standalone page can [here](https://will62794.github.io/tla-web/doc/embed.html), with the basic HTML source for that page found [here](https://github.com/will62794/tla-web/blob/master/doc/embed.html). Basically, you can use that as a template for a webpage that embeds the interpreter. You will also need to include these Javascript dependencies as well (e.g. manually download them to a location accessible from your webpage). In future, it should be possible to also embed specific sub-components of the user interface, such as the editor or the visualizer, directly in a separate webpage as well.
