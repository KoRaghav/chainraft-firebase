# Embedding in a Webpage

In addition to using the TLA+ web explorer from the main interface, you should be able to embed various features of the TLA+ web explorer in other, standalone web pages. All of the functionality is self-contained and runnable in the browser, so it should be relatively straightforward.

To start, you can see a basic example of embedding just the interpreter functionality in a standalone webpage [here](https://will62794.github.io/tla-web/doc/embed.html), where the HTML source for that page is located [here](https://github.com/will62794/tla-web/blob/master/doc/embed.html). You can use that page as a starting template for embedding the interpreter in your own page. Note that you will need to include [the Javascript dependencies linked there](https://github.com/will62794/tla-web/blob/4c6e20d0c828bdfe34212a02de4b5ce82894d8fd/doc/embed.html#L8-L12) as well (e.g. manually download them to a location accessible from your webpage). 

In future, one goal is to have a better way of packaging up these scripts in a more user-friendly way, that makes including them in your own page easier. It should also be possible to also embed specific sub-components of the user interface, such as the editor or the visualizer, directly in a separate webpage as well.
